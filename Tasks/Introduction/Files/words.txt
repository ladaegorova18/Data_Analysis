Once all the engineering professors were sitting in one plane. 
Before the takeoff, one announcement came
- This plane is made by your students 
Then all professors stood up, ran and went outside. 
But the principal was sitting. 
One guy came and asked: 
- Are you not afraid? 
Then the principal replied 
- I trust my students very well and I am sure the plane wonâ€™t even start.
